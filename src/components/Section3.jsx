Most templates are a pain, code is scattered, and near impossible to theme. Flowbite has code in one place and I'm not joking when I say it took me a matter of minutes to copy the code, customise it and integrate within a Laravel + Vue application. If you care for your time, I hands down would go with this."`,

From the most used UI components like forms and navigation bars to the whole app screens designed both for desktop and mobile, this UI kit provides a solid foundation for any project. Designing with Figma components that can be easily translated to the utility classes of Tailwind CSS is a huge timesaver!"`,

Everything is so well structured and simple to use (I've learnt so much about Figma by just using the toolkit). Aesthetically, the well designed components are beautiful and will undoubtedly level up your next application."`,
